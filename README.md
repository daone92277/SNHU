# Week 8-1 Journal Assignemnt 
SNHU Computer Science BS
Prompt
For this course, you will select one project to submit into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. You should submit all relevant files from your selected project to your GitHub repository. These will showcase your work with programming languages and most specifically C++. These files also demonstrate your ability to write well-documented and readable code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in this project. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below, using the sub-bullets to help guide your thoughts. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My answers below:
1.  The program is an item tracker that reads input from a file, stores the frequencies of each item in a map, and provides functionality to look up item frequencies, print item frequencies, and print a histogram. The problem it solves is keeping track of the frequencies of different items.
   
3.  The program does a good job of reading input from a file, storing item frequencies in a map, and providing the desired functionality through a menu-driven interface.
   
4.  One potential enhancement could be error handling for file input/output operations. Checking for errors during file operations and handling them appropriately would make the code more robust and secure. Additionally, the program could benefit from input validation to handle invalid user inputs and prevent unexpected behavior.
   
5. The Program does not seem to have any particularly challenging pieces. It is a relatively straightforward implementation. To overcome any challenges, I usually  refer to documentation or online resources for guidance. I also have a  support network of experienced developers and im part of a programming community that provides valuable assistance and resources.
   
7.  The skills from this project that would be transferable to other projects or coursework include file input/output operations, working with maps and string manipulation, implementing a menu-driven interface, and basic error handling.

8. The program demonstrates maintainability, readability, and adaptability through the use of clear and descriptive variable and function names, proper indentation and formatting, and the separation of concerns into different functions. The code is organized and easy to understand, making it easier to maintain and adapt in the future.
