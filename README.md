SNHU Computer Science BS
Prompt
For this course, you will select one project to submit into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. You should submit all relevant files from your selected project to your GitHub repository. These will showcase your work with programming languages and most specifically C++. These files also demonstrate your ability to write well-documented and readable code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in this project. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below, using the sub-bullets to help guide your thoughts. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
